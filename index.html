  <p class="section-text">I’ve been thinking about you constantly, about us, and about everything I could have done better. I want you to know that this message comes from a place of honesty, humility, and deep love. I understand that trust is fragile, and once it’s shaken, it takes time, consistency, and real effort to rebuild. I am not afraid of that work. I welcome it, because you are worth it to me in every way.

I want to acknowledge your feelings fully. I know you’re hurting, confused, and unsure, and I don’t blame you for that. Your emotions make sense, and I respect them. I’m not here to rush you, pressure you, or minimize what you’re going through. I just want you to know that I see you, I hear you, and I care deeply about how you feel.

From the bottom of my heart, I promise you this: I am committed to being completely open and honest with you, always. No secrets, no hiding, no half-truths ever again. I want to be someone you can feel safe around, someone you never have to question. Every day, every minute, I will do my best to prove that through my actions, not just my words. I want to grow, to learn, and to become a better partner for you, someone who brings you peace, not doubt.

I love you more than I can properly explain. My love for you isn’t shallow or temporary, it’s deep, constant, and real. You matter to me in ways that go beyond convenience or comfort. I miss you. I miss being close to you, hearing your voice, feeling your presence, and sharing life with you. I can’t wait to be by your side again, to create new memories and rebuild what feels broken with patience and care.

When you see this, I hope you’ll reach back to me and talk to me. I want us to communicate in a calm, loving way, without fear, without anger, just honesty and understanding. I promise to listen to you not only with my ears, but with my heart and my soul. I want to truly understand you, not defend myself or interrupt, but genuinely hear you and learn from you. Your thoughts and feelings matter deeply to me.

Please know that I am always here for you. No matter the time, no matter the situation, no matter how heavy things feel, I will always care for you. I don’t love you only when things are easy. I love you through uncertainty, through growth, through healing. My care for you is constant, and it doesn’t disappear when things get hard.

Most importantly, I want you to understand this clearly: I have always loved you. From the beginning, I loved you sincerely, and that love has never faded. I love you now, in this moment, with patience and hope. And I will always love you, no matter where life leads us, no matter how much time passes, even beyond this life itself. My love for you is something I carry with me always.

I dont want to rush you. I won’t leave. I’ll be here, choosing honesty, choosing growth, choosing you, every single day, with an open heart and unconditional care.

Always.

Jack "lovely" Ferry.</p>
